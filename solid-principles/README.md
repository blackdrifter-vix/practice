SOLID principles are a set of design principles in object-oriented programming that help make software more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. Here's a brief explanation of each principle along with an example in JavaScript:

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):
A class should have one, and only one, reason to change.

Open/Closed Principle (OCP):
Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):
Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.

Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):
Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.

Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
